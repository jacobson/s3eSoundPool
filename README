s3eSoundPool is a Marmalade extension for the Android SoundPool API. It allows for preloading of sound samples, which can help achieve low latency.

s3eSoundPool's interface is similar to that of s3eSound's:

- Sound samples must be preloaded with s3eSoundPoolSampleLoad before playing
- Samples are played by ID using s3eSoundPoolSamplePlay
- Samples can be paused and resumes with s3eSoundPoolSamplePause and s3eSoundPoolSampleResume, respectively
- A callback to detect when samples have finished playing can be registered using s3eSoundPoolRegister
- Sample state can be polled using s3eSoundPoolSampleGetInt

Please see 's3eSoundPool.h' for more details.

To use this extension in another project include 's3eSoundPool' in the subprojects section of the project's mkb file.
